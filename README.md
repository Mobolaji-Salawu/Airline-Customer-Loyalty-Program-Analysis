# ✈️ Airline Customer Loyalty Program Analysis
A data exploration project by Mobolaji Salawu

📑 Overview
In today’s highly competitive airline industry, retaining loyal customers is just as crucial as acquiring new ones. Customer loyalty programs play a pivotal role in strengthening customer relationships, enhancing brand preference, and driving repeat bookings. This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on two key datasets:

Customer Loyalty Program Members Data: detailing customer profiles and loyalty status.

Customer Flight Activity Data: tracking travel patterns and booking behaviors.

The analysis is designed to uncover trends, identify customer segments, and provide insights that could inform smarter promotional strategies and loyalty program improvements.

🎯 Why It Matters
✈️ Relevance of Loyalty Programs in the Airline Industry
Airline loyalty programs have evolved beyond mere mileage accumulation schemes. They’re vital strategic assets that help airlines reward frequent travelers, foster customer retention, and personalize service offerings. Understanding loyalty member behavior enables airlines to optimize flight schedules, tailor rewards, and maintain a competitive edge in a dynamic market.

📈 Impact of Well-Designed Promotional Campaigns
A thoughtful, data-driven promotional campaign can make a measurable difference in customer engagement and revenue. By identifying the most responsive customer groups and analyzing their flight patterns, airlines can design targeted promotions that resonate. Data-backed promotions ensure marketing efforts are efficient, timely, and aligned with actual customer preferences.

🔍 The Importance of Data Analysis in Surfacing Trends
Raw data is just noise without proper analysis. Through exploratory data analysis, we can transform complex flight activity logs and loyalty membership records into clear, actionable insights:

Discover trends in customer flight frequency and preferred routes.
