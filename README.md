# ✈️ Airline Customer Loyalty Program Analysis
A data exploration project by Mobolaji Salawu

# 📑 Overview
In today’s highly competitive airline industry, retaining loyal customers is just as crucial as acquiring new ones. Customer loyalty programs play a pivotal role in strengthening customer relationships, enhancing brand preference, and driving repeat bookings. This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on two key datasets:

* **Customer Loyalty Program Members Data:** containing customer demographic details and membership information

* **Customer Flight Activity Data:** tracking loyalty members flight histories

The analysis is designed to uncover trends, identify customer segments, and provide insights that could inform smarter promotional strategies and loyalty program improvements.

# 🎯 Why It Matters
## ✈️ Relevance of Loyalty Programs in the Airline Industry
Customer loyalty programs are more than just point-accumulation systems — they are strategic tools that help airlines build long-term relationships with frequent flyers. Understanding the behavior and preferences of loyalty program members allows airlines to tailor offerings, enhance customer experience, and maintain a competitive edge.

## 📈 Impact of Well-Designed Promotional Campaigns
A well-thought-out, data-driven promotional campaign can significantly increase customer engagement, boost flight bookings, and strengthen brand loyalty. By identifying the most active customer segments, optimal promotional periods, and preferred destinations, airlines can design targeted promotions that resonate with their audience and maximize returns. Data-backed promotions ensure marketing efforts are efficient, timely, and aligned with actual customer preferences.

## 🔍 The Importance of Data Analysis in Surfacing Trends
Raw data on its own can be overwhelming and difficult to interpret. Through exploratory data analysis, we can transform raw flight and membership data into actionable insights. This includes uncovering:

* Trends in customer flight activity.
* Correlations between loyalty program status and travel behavior.

* Seasonal patterns and peak travel periods.

* Segments of customers with high potential for targeted marketing.
